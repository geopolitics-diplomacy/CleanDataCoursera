Susana Quinonez Week 4 Getting and cleaning data in R course March 13,
2021
=======================================================================================================
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect,
work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that
can be used for later analysis. It will be graded by my peers on a
series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required
to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github
repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code
book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or
work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You
should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo
explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected

**Making sure I have all the packages I need to manipulate datasets **

**Downloading the zip file to my local current directory and creating my
datasets based on the given files**

      zipFile <- "week4Project.zip"
      # Checking if archieve already exists.
      if (!file.exists(zipFile)) {
        zipUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
        download.file(zipUrl, zipFile, method="curl")
      }  
      
        if (!file.exists("UCI HAR Dataset")) { 
           unzip(zipFile) 
      }  
      print("Week 4 project");

    ## [1] "Week 4 project"

      ## I must read the files first and create the dataset with each file:
      ##Getting the features(col names)  first
      ## Getting the  data column names and activities 
      ## dataset features contains the description of the features
      ## dataset activities contains the activity id and the the 
      ## activity description 
      
      features <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")[,2]
      activities <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt");
      names(activities) <- c("activity_id", "activity_desc");

      ##getting training sets:

      x_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt");
      y_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt")
      
      names(x_train) <- features;
      names(y_train) <- c("activity_id");
      head("y_train,2********************************************************")

    ## [1] "y_train,2********************************************************"

      ##print(head(y_train,2));
      subject_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")
      names(subject_train) <- c("subject_No");
      subject_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")
      names(subject_test) <- c("subject_No");  
      x_test <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")
      y_test <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt")
      names(y_test)<- c("activity_id")
      ##print("y_test: ******************")
      ##print(head(y_test,3))
      names(x_test) <- features;

      #1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
      x <- rbind(x_train, x_test);
      y <- rbind(y_train, y_test);
      subjects <- rbind(subject_train,subject_test);

**1. the Merge**

    subjects_data <- cbind(subjects, x,y);  ## This is the merge data set

**2.0 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
for each measurement **

     mean_StandardDev <- subjects_data %>%  select(subject_No,activity_id,
                                                 contains("mean"), contains("std"));

**3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
set **

       ## To every record in mean_StandardDev, I replace the activity_id, which
         ## contains the activity code and I replace it with the description 
         ## matching that code in the activities dataset
         mean_StandardDev$activity_id <- activities[mean_StandardDev$activity_id, 2] ;

**4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names**

       library(stringr); ## so I can manipule strings
          names(mean_StandardDev)<-gsub("^t", "Time", names(mean_StandardDev))
          names(mean_StandardDev)<-gsub("^f", "Frequency", names(mean_StandardDev))
          names(mean_StandardDev)<-gsub("-", " ", names(mean_StandardDev))
          names(mean_StandardDev)<-gsub("()", "", names(mean_StandardDev))

**5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
subject.**

    ## With the tidy data I can group by subject_No ( the subject) and activity
    ## and then getting the mean from all columns
          
          ## Here I am renaming the column name of activity_id to 
          ## activity because I replaced its content with the activity
          ## description in question No. 3
          colnames(mean_StandardDev)[2]  <- "activity";

          ind_tidy_data <- mean_StandardDev %>%
                        group_by(subject_No, activity) %>%
                        summarise_all(funs(mean))

    ## Warning: `funs()` is deprecated as of dplyr 0.8.0.
    ## Please use a list of either functions or lambdas: 
    ## 
    ##   # Simple named list: 
    ##   list(mean = mean, median = median)
    ## 
    ##   # Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: 
    ##   tibble::lst(mean, median)
    ## 
    ##   # Using lambdas
    ##   list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))
    ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
    ## Call `lifecycle::last_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated.

**Writing the result data into the ind\_tidy\_data.txt **

    write.table(ind_tidy_data, "ind_tidy_data.txt", row.name=FALSE)
